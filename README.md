# JICS-IsotopeJS-Image-Gallery
Add this to a JICS portlet and upload some photos to enjoy a responsive Isotope image gallery.

This code can be added directly into the free-form content editor. Be sure to use the code input view.

After adding this code, place the div with a class of grid (included in the JICS-Isotope-gallery.html file) into your portlet code wherever you want the images to display. Upload your images through the default uploader. No need to drag and drop them into the text area. The images will automatically display in your portlet.
