# JICS-IsotopeJS-Image-Gallery
Add this to a JICS portlet and upload some photos to enjoy a responsive Isotope image gallery.

This code can be added directly into the free-form content editor. Be sure to use the code input view.

After adding this code, place the div with a class of grid (included in the JICS-Isotope-gallery.html file) into your portlet code wherever you want the images to display. Upload your images through the default uploader. No need to drag and drop them into the text area. The images will automatically display in your portlet.

This code has been tested with JICS v8.2.0.

Please note that this may not be the best way to implement this functionality. This code is designed to work if you only have access to edit portlets. If you have access to the JICS file structure, you may find it better to include some or all of this code in another location.
